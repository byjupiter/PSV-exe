Develop what song this is

Until the East sea dries and Mt.Beakdu wears
God will help us, Mansae to our country
â€‹(Mansae is kind of a hurray!)
*Mugunghwa, the whole of Korea, such a glorious land
(Three Hundred Lee means the whole of Korea)
Let's remain and continue being the great race

The pine on Namsan is like armored
Despite wind and frost, it never changes with single-minded devotion
*Mugunghwa, the whole of Korea, such a glorious land
(Three Hundred Lee means the whole of Korea)
Let's remain and continue being the great race

Autumn's sky is empty and spacious, high with no clouds
Bright moon is our heart's single-mind
*Mugunghwa, the whole of Korea, such a glorious land
(Three Hundred Lee means the whole of Korea)
Let's remain and continue being the great race

be loyal with this spirit and mind,
Even if you are painful or joyful, love our country
*Mugunghwa, the whole of Korea, such a glorious land
(Three Hundred Lee means the whole of Korea)
Let's remain and continue being the great race
